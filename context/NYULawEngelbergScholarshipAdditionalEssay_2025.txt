Patching the System: Architecting IP Frameworks for the AI Era
To a developer, code is absolute; it either executes or it fails. However, the transition from writing Python scripts to managing enterprise-grade AI architectures revealed a startling contrast: the laws governing innovation are far less binary. They are full of "bugs," outdated definitions that fail to compile in the modern age of Generative AI.
My interest in the Engelberg Center began as a loyal newsletter subscriber, but a specific frustration on the technical frontlines forged that interest into a passion. While prototyping an AI Agent using the Google ADK, my team achieved a genuine technical breakthrough. We utilized Python for backend logic and cloud-native orchestration to automate complex workflows. The code was novel and the utility was clear. But approaching the threshold of intellectual property protection brought us to a standstill.
The current patent framework, designed largely for mechanical inventions and human-centric inventorship, offered no clear path for an innovation built on the shifting sands of a third-party GenAI platform. Was our agent a patentable "new and useful process," or merely an abstract idea implemented on the cloud? Was it a "derivative work" forever tethered to the underlying platform's terms?
Because the law lacked the precision to define the ownership of this AI-assisted innovation, securing it became impossible. This experience exposed a systemic flaw: the widening gap between the velocity of digital creation and the rigidity of IP statutes. If this gap persists, companies may retreat from the patent system, which encourages public disclosure, and instead lock innovations behind "Trade Secrets." Such a shift risks fracturing the open exchange of ideas that fuels technological progress.
The Engelberg Scholarship is the best platform to evolve from a practitioner navigating existing laws to a scholar helping to update them. I am eager to share my extensive real-world experience with the cohort, as well as the knowledge that is essential for defining the nuances of AI patent eligibility and copyright. I believe my fluency in Python, SQL, and full-stack development could add immediate value to the community. Meanwhile, I aim to research within the Center and design policy frameworks that balance proprietary protection with the collaborative nature of open-source and AI development. 
Within the Center, I am confident that I can find the answers to those questions I have been pondering: How do we redefine "non-obviousness" when an AI can iterate a thousand designs in a second? How do we incentivize API-based innovation without creating patent thickets? Combining technical fluency with the Engelberg Center’s legal rigor will allow me to contribute to architecting a new IP framework, one as dynamic and forward-looking as the innovations it seeks to protect.
