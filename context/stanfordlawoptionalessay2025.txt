For years, my professional worldview was governed by a single, unassailable metric: optimization. In the tech ecosystem, efficiency is often treated not just as a goal, but as a moral imperative. As a Technical Lead, I was trained to view friction as failure and ambiguity as a bug. I believed that math was the ultimate arbiter of truth: if an algorithm could increase engagement rates by 15% while reducing costs, it was, by definition, a "good" algorithm.
This belief system was challenged during a project at Aetna, where my team was tasked with automating patient outreach for a chronic disease management program. We built a predictive model designed to identify members most likely to engage with our digital health app. The logic was sound: by concentrating resources on 'high-propensity' users, we could serve them more diligently, thereby maximizing our Return on Investment (ROI). I was proud of the model’s efficiency. However, during a cross-functional review, a Senior Clinical Director, with decades of experience in community health, pushed back.
"This model isn't just efficient," she said. "It is exclusionary." I felt a rising defensiveness. I doubled down on my projections, arguing that math is neutral and that we were simply prioritizing engagement. To me, her objection felt emotional, a refusal to face the hard reality of budget constraints. I was solving for solvency; she was solving for equity. She didn't fight my math; she challenged my premise. She asked me to stratify the "low-propensity" group, the people my model ignored, by demographic data. Reluctantly, I ran the query.
The results were a shock. The group I was effectively "redlining" was disproportionately elderly, low-income, and rural. They weren't "uninterested" in health; they simply lacked the smartphones required to engage. "You are optimizing for ease, not for need," she told me.
That moment dismantled my assumption that data is neutral. I realized that my code had encoded the bias of digital privilege. I pivoted immediately, working with her to introduce a "fairness constraint" into the model, deliberately sacrificing statistical efficiency to ensure equitable access.
If I were to encounter this same scenario today, my response would differ not just in attitude, but in architecture. First, I would fundamentally alter the design process. In the original project, I treated the Clinical Director as a "reviewer" at the end of the pipeline. Today, I would treat her as a "co-architect" from day one. I now practice "adversarial design". This means actively inviting non-technical stakeholders to stress-test our objective functions before a single line of code is written. Second, I would redefine success metrics. Back then, I let ROI define the problem because it was easy to measure. Today, I understand that efficiency is a default metric, but justice is a designed one. I would explicitly code "equity" into the project's KPI structure, ensuring that our algorithm is penalized for demographic skew, just as it is penalized for high latency. Finally, I would manage my own intellectual defensiveness differently. When challenged, my instinct was to protect the integrity of my logic. Today, I recognize that "friction" in a discussion is not an impediment to progress; it is data. I would view her objection not as an attack on my competence, but as a "system warning" that my model was overfitting to a privileged reality.
As I transition to law, I carry this lesson with me: whether we are writing code or writing laws, we must ensure that our drive for efficiency never compromises our commitment to equity.
