Hello, I'm Juno. I grew up in Beijing and was born on June 12, 1997.

I am an only child in my family—no brothers or sisters. I consider myself a "policy-mandated only daughter" of the One Child Policy era.

In elementary school, I didn't actually stand out much. Sometimes, my parents would even get called into the school by the teachers. So, I wasn't exactly a naturally gifted child. However, I was—and am—very hardworking. If there was something I didn't know, or a difficult problem in my coursework, I would focus intensely on solving it, chipping away at it until the issue was completely resolved.

Starting in middle school, my various talents began to be discovered. For instance, I took on the role of class monitor. By high school, I was organizing all the major annual events for our grade, which included communicating with various companies, securing subscriptions, and managing catering. My teachers really liked me. When there were limited, complimentary spots to go to Russia for an exchange study program—a summer program lasting about seven days—I was selected to participate.

So, during middle and high school, I felt I lived quite happily, constantly learning subjects I enjoyed. Around my sophomore year of high school, I started to feel that I wasn't fully satisfied with learning only within China. I began exploring the possibility of studying in the United States.

Combined with this, I personally love traveling. I've been to over ten countries and regions—Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, New Zealand, Australia, and so on. I love going out and seeing the world. International culture naturally attracts me.

Furthermore, part of me isn't the type to stick strictly to convention; I prefer breakthroughs and innovation. I felt that in the US, I could better leverage my strengths.

Another reason I became interested in technology stems from my first visit to Hong Kong, where I searched for a specific keyword: "Tiananmen Square." I had heard about these events when I was small, but I didn't know the context, and adults were unwilling to discuss it. That Google Search truly opened a massive door for me.

Later, during university, I studied at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., double majoring in Finance and Statistics. The curriculum was quite heavy, especially since it was a Bachelor of Science degree, but I loved reading and learning. I participated in many internships and accumulated a lot of experience; I never said "no" to a job opportunity. Some standout experiences included interning at the World Bank and working as a research assistant at the Business School.

I studied hard and eventually graduated with the highest Latin honors, holding a GPA of 3.85.

Simultaneously, I received an offer from Ernst & Young (EY) in New York City to become a Tech Consultant. At EY, I learned a great deal. At a very young age, I was able to lead the implementation of large-scale projects and communicate directly with Fortune 500 clients.

Three years later, I transitioned to CVS Health, specifically working on the Aetna insurance side. Here, I became a Senior Manager. I manage more people now, and there are many deliverables on my shoulders that I need to carry. While the pressure is high, I am very happy because I'm doing work I enjoy and can communicate with various stakeholders.

I have articulated in my documents specifically why I want to study law. Especially, I aspire to become a "trilingual" professional—a translator bridging the gaps between Technology, Business, and Law.

I am also very confident. With my years of cross-cultural and cross-national board experience in learning and working, I believe I have the capability to become an excellent JD candidate and contribute positively to the legal profession in the future.

So, that is essentially my long journey from Beijing to Washington D.C., and then to New York. It has been a long journey, but I truly enjoyed it, and I look forward to more.

Oh, I forgot to mention—my interests have always been very broad since I was young.

I started learning the Baritone horn in the third grade of elementary school. Later, starting in the sixth grade, I began playing tennis. Even under heavy academic pressure, I never gave up on these two hobbies. Every time, I managed to squeeze in time for training with the orchestra or the tennis team.

I achieved excellent results in both: I reached the highest amateur level certification for my instrument, and for tennis, I reached the level of a National Second-Class Athlete in China.

Aside from this, my personal hobbies include baking, an interest that started during COVID. I think baking is a very happy thing—smelling the rich aroma of butter and making delicious, beautiful desserts for the family and friends I care about is a deeply fulfilling experience.
