For the past nine years, the United States has been more than a place of study and work; it is my second home. My connection is built on nearly a decade of experiences, from rowing in Central Park on Sunday mornings to attending over sixty Broadway productions that shaped my cultural understanding. I have grown alongside this city, contributing to its diversity and finding my voice within its rhythm. My desire to study law here is rooted in a deep commitment to the community I consider my own.
This commitment extends to my professional vision. We stand at a pivotal moment in history where artificial intelligence will redefine global governance. As the two dominant players in this field, the United States and China are destined to shape the trajectory of this technology. However, their approaches differ fundamentally. To effectively govern the future of AI, legal scholars must understand both narratives. A purely unilateral perspective is no longer sufficient to address the complexities of algorithmic bias, data privacy, and intellectual property in a borderless digital world.
Columbia Law School is the only institution where I can fully realize this vision. In 1983, Columbia established the Center for Chinese Legal Studies, the first academic center of its kind in the United States. Now known as the Hong Yen Chang Center for Chinese Legal Studies, it has served as the intellectual bridge between these two legal systems for over forty years. I aim to continue this legacy. By combining my cultural heritage with an American legal education, I hope to foster the dialogue necessary to create robust, globally compatible AI governance frameworks. I am eager to dedicate my career to this critical intersection and to continue contributing to the New York community that has given me so much.
