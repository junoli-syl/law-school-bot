For years, my professional worldview was governed by a single, unassailable metric: optimization. In the tech ecosystem, efficiency is often treated not just as a goal, but as a moral imperative. As a Technical Lead, I was trained to view friction as failure and ambiguity as a bug. I believed that math was the ultimate arbiter of truth: if an algorithm could increase engagement rates by 15% while reducing costs, it was, by definition, a good algorithm.
This belief system fractured during a project at Aetna, where my team was tasked with automating patient outreach for a chronic disease management program. We built a predictive model designed to identify members most likely to engage with our digital health app. The logic was sound: by concentrating resources on high-propensity users, we could serve them more diligently, maximizing our Return on Investment. I was proud of the model’s efficiency. However, during a review, a Senior Clinical Director with decades of experience in community health pushed back.
“This model isn’t just efficient,” she said. “It is exclusive.”
I felt a rising defensiveness. I initially doubled down on my projections, arguing that math is neutral and that we were simply prioritizing engagement. She didn’t dispute the math; instead, she challenged the premise and asked me to stratify the “low-propensity” group by demographics—variables my model had largely ignored. The results were a shock. The group I was effectively redlining was disproportionately elderly, low-income, and rural. They weren’t uninterested in health; they simply lacked the smartphones required to engage. I realized then that while I was solving for solvency, she was solving for equity.
That moment dismantled my assumption that data is neutral. My code had unwittingly encoded the bias of digital privilege. I confronted this failure by pivoting immediately, working with her to introduce a fairness constraint into the model and deliberately sacrificing statistical efficiency to ensure equitable access.
If I were to encounter this scenario today, however, my approach would differ fundamentally in both architecture and attitude. I would not wait for a review to discover bias; I would practice adversarial design from day one, inviting non-technical stakeholders to stress-test our objective functions before a single line of code is written. I would also explicitly code equity into the KPI structure, ensuring the algorithm is penalized for demographic skew just as it is for high latency.
Most importantly, I would manage my own intellectual defensiveness differently. When challenged, my instinct was to protect the integrity of my logic. Today, I recognize that friction is not an impediment to progress; it is data. I would approach her objection not as an attack, but as a critical system warning that my model was overfitting to a privileged reality.
This experience taught me that correctness is a consensus reached through the friction of differing perspectives. Data is not objective truth; it is a historical artifact. I aspire to engage in these necessary, difficult discussions at law school, ensuring that the blind spots in our data do not become blind spots in our justice system.
