Prompt: If you could sit and chat with anyone, living or from any time in history, who would you chat with? What's one question you'd ask?  Why?  
I would choose to chat with Rear Admiral Grace Hopper, the pioneer who invented the first compiler.
My question would be: "You invented the first compiler to bridge the gap between human language and machine code because you believed technology should be accessible. Today, we face the opposite problem: machines are speaking, but our laws cannot understand them. How did you distinguish between a systemic limitation that had to be accepted, and a legacy rule that demanded to be broken?"
I ask this because I see myself as following in her footsteps by translating between Algorithms and the Law. In my work, I face outdated statutes like Section 230 that act as "bugs" in the system, forcing us to lobotomize AI potential. Hopper faced immense bureaucratic resistance when she claimed computers could do more than arithmetic. I want to understand where she found the conviction to redefine the framework when the establishment said it was impossible. Her insight would be the ultimate mentorship for my goal of architecting legal frameworks for the algorithmic age.
