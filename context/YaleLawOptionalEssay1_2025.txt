At Aetna, I prototyped a 24/7 AI agent to handle member inquiries. While the business goal was efficiency, the true value was accessibility. For a single immigrant parent verifying coverage at 3 AM, the bot was a lifeline that translated bureaucratic policy into plain answers. This experience revealed that the greatest barrier to essential services is often linguistic complexity rather than a lack of resources.
The legal market currently fails to solve this problem. It is starkly polarized. On one end, B2B platforms like Harvey provide "luxury automation" for elite law firms. On the other, consumer tools like DoNotPay have faced regulatory scrutiny for sacrificing accuracy for speed. This leaves a dangerous void. Millions of immigrant families are trapped between attorneys they cannot afford and "robot lawyers" they cannot trust.
My objective is to fill this gap. I aim to build AI agents that serve as responsible semantic bridges. Unlike current tools, these agents will be architected to translate "legalese" into clear language while strictly adhering to legal standards. This empowers households to navigate their rights without the barrier of a high retainer. Efficiency in this context does not just protect profit margins. It scales justice.
This project is a microcosm of the IP and tech law intersection driving my application. I look to Yale to engage with foundational questions of how legal frameworks must evolve to govern such innovations, ensuring the next generation of technology is not just efficient, but equitable.
