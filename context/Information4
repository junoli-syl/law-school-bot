No one ever expects me to walk through the door at PI planning—I am too young and too female to be a Senior Manager in Technology. Over the past five years, I’ve led countless technical design thinking sessions, yet they rarely see me coming. I compose myself, ignoring subtle shifts—the raised eyebrows, the puzzled looks, and the way their body language tightens, as though I’m somehow an anomaly in a space I’ve earned the right to be in.
But this armor was not easily forged. Early in my career, the quiet violence of underestimation often caught me off guard. I remember a specific strategy call at EY years ago. I was the only woman on the line, finalizing the talking points for a complex implementation I had designed. Suddenly, a Partner’s voice cut through the mix: “Juno, I hope you are taking notes.” The silence that followed lasted only a few seconds, but it felt like hours. It wasn't just embarrassment that froze me; it was a haunting recognition. I had heard that dismissive tone my entire life.
Born during the peak of the one-child policy—a demographic engineering project that resulted in twenty million “missing girls”—my existence was a statistical outlier. In a society where sons were the mandated investment for a family’s future, being born female often meant being discarded. I survived the statistics, but the implicit message that I was “lesser” followed me for years. I was never allowed to eat at the main table at the Chinese New Year's Eve dinner; I was excluded from the family genealogy, which recorded only the male bloodline; I was discouraged from taking advanced sciences in high school because “girls possess early intelligence but lack the intellectual stamina.” 
Many doors were shut before I could even knock. To break them, I decided to break the “model minority” mold first. I stopped being quiet and demure; I raised my hand for demanding work; I advocated for my achievements whenever possible; I became “loud” and “aggressive.” Over the years, I mastered tactics to challenge the assumptions that had initially excluded me. 
Back on that call, I broke the silence: “It’s gonna be hard to take notes while presenting the architecture diagram,” I replied, my tone laced with amusement. “Can anyone else take notes?”
 As I proceeded to explain how my technical blueprint streamlines Enterprise platforms while ensuring future scalability, I realized something vital: I was no longer the girl waiting for a seat at the main table. I had built my own table, and I had plenty to say. 
My experiences thus far have fueled my drive to challenge the status quo. I understand how representation can uncover blind spots and shift policy discussions. To amplify women's voices, I lead Women in Technology at each company I serve, building networks for colleagues and mentoring young female STEM talent. At law school, I aim to translate this advocacy into legal action. My goal is to advance reforms that protect female innovators—specifically by closing the gender patenting gap. I want to ensure that women are not just participants in technology, but recognized owners of their intellectual property, erasing the systemic invisibility I once faced.
