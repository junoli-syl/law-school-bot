My journey as a translator began not in a corporate boardroom, but in a dimly lit living room, sitting on the floor in front of an old, boxy television set. As the evening news played in standard Mandarin, I sat beside my grandmother, translating the anchor’s words sentence by sentence into our local dialect. Amidst the flicker of the screen, I first understood the power of bridging the gap between confusion and understanding.
This role evolved from a familial duty to a cultural bridge when I volunteered to guide European visiting scholars through the Forbidden City and the Great Wall. Years later, this role professionalized when I was selected to tutor U.S. State Department diplomats in Chinese. It was my first experience facilitating understanding at a policy level. My horizon soon expanded to the language of logic and statistics. During my junior year of college, I leveraged my technical proficiency to secure a summer internship at the World Bank, a position typically reserved for doctoral candidates. There, I translated dense Project Appraisal Documents into accessible data. Using R code I developed myself, I transformed thousands of pages of unstructured text into a structured search tool that remains active today. This was my first foray into Natural Language Processing (NLP) before I even knew the term.
At Ernst & Young and later as a Senior Manager at Aetna, I expanded my role into the corporate sphere and formalized it as a translator between Business and Technology. I thrived on deconstructing complex technical specs into value propositions that stakeholders could grasp. Conversely, I translated abstract business goals into executable, code-level architectures. Mastering Python, SQL, and Java, I became a bilingual professional, equally fluent in C-suite strategy and full-stack engineering. My recent achievement was a machine learning pipeline that synthesized enterprise data, such as claims, staffing, and member preferences, to optimize engagement. The demo secured immediate executive backing, cementing my reputation as the indispensable link between IT and Business. As my models grew more sophisticated, the thrill of engineering gave way to a new friction. I realized the greatest barriers to innovation were no longer technical limitations, but legal ambiguities.
This hit home when I led the deployment of a customer-facing GenAI chatbot. The business goal was 24/7 automated member support, but we collided with the ambiguity of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Enacted in 1996 to protect platforms from user-generated content, the statute offers no clear shield for AI-generated hallucinations. If our model inadvertently fabricated medical coverage details or defamed a provider, would we be liable as a publisher? The law was silent. As a result, despite the technical readiness, we had to severely restrict the model's capabilities, 'lobotomizing' its intelligence to mitigate unquantifiable liability risks. We were ready to run, but the outdated legal infrastructure forced us to crawl."
In those moments, the weekly meetings about KPIs felt suffocating because I knew we were leaving value on the table. Hitting these invisible walls made my technical victories feel incomplete. I realized that to truly protect and scale innovation, I cannot just be the person who builds the engine; I must also be the one who writes the rules of the road. Being a bilingual translator of Technology and Business is no longer enough. To lead in the age of algorithmic decision-making, I must become trilingual.
I am applying to law school to master this third language. I seek to merge my technical expertise and business acumen with a rigorous understanding of the law. My background in Computer Science and Statistics equips me to do more than discuss policy; it prepares me to draft patents for complex machine learning architectures by translating the abstract logic of neural networks into defensible intellectual property. Whether ensuring that liability frameworks evolve alongside Generative AI, or defining intellectual property rights at a granular level, I aim to not only clear the path for innovation but to architect the frameworks that sustain it. From my grandmother’s living room to the forefront of legal-tech leadership, my goal remains the same: to bridge the gap where understanding fails.
